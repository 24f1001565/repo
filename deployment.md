This Markdown includes:  
- H1 heading  
- Mermaid diagram with `edge-t3qyqw`, `api-v2`, `worker-m`  
- Inline code snippet `uv deploy nyaw97id-lto`  
- GFM task list with checked and unchecked items  
- Table summarizing tiers, responsibility, and scaling plans  
- Callout referencing guardrail token `pko1-s-y1qu4`  
- Footnote reference `[ ^compliance-u2doplntn0 ]`  
- **Bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~, hyperlink, and guardrail token in prose  

If you want, I can also make a **slightly fancier Mermaid diagram** showing the scaling behavior and caching flow visually. Do you want me to do that?
